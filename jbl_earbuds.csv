"premium sound quality well balanced ,ANC works fine , very comfortable buds doesn't fall while running, fast charging battery, everything is perfect",14 July 2025,1
"This is not just a bad product – it’s an insult to customers. I’ve used local roadside ₹500 earbuds that sound 10 times better than this garbage. The volume is laughably low – even at max, it sounds like 3 bars out of 10. There’s a constant irritating airflow/humming noise that overpowers the actual audio. Music? Forget it. You’ll only hear cheap buzzing static like some broken radio.This feels like a rip-off sold under the disguise of “earbuds”. The build, sound, and everything about it screams sub-standard, third-class quality. To make things worse, there’s no return option – clearly the seller knows no one would keep this junk after using it once.This product is a pure scam, a waste of money, and honestly, it shouldn’t even be allowed to be sold online. If you’re reading this, do yourself a favor –RUN AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT WITHOUT ANY SECOND THOUGHT. You will not just regret buying it, you’ll be angry that you ever trusted it.",24 July 2025,1
Just improve bassNot big sound effectANC is not good as we expected,5 May 2025,1
Well it's good I love this product worth moneyAnd it's noise cancelation and all functions working good,19 July 2025,1
"First of all, these ear buds does not have Cover so this is first shock when you receive the product. That means not easy to carry and you have fear of losing buds (though magnet is powerful but little hard push and this may come out). Taking out Buds from the case is a task, and one may feel victory when actually comes out successfully, it is not user friendly. JBL needs to think on this. Fitness of Buds in ear is not so great but not so poor as well. Sound quality of music is an average quality and not at JBL's standard (i am using JBL Tune 510 BT & JBL Cinema SB190 as well). This product is of not that standard in terms of quality. Touch sensors and controls are wokring perfect. Battery perfromance is ok. Call Quality is ok for regular use with 4 mics this works, ANC needs to be more powerful. Pairing more than 1 device is challengin some time and its take time to connect to more than one device.",18 June 2025,1
Nice product value for money spent,5 August 2025,1
"*JBL Wave Buds 2 – Very Disappointing Product**1. It doesn't come with a protective cap.2. Not suitable for making calls.3. It is overpriced, and the call quality is very poor.4. No return option available.I visited the JBL service center and reported that the call volume is too low — it's hard to hear anything in traffic, and the person on the other end also struggles to hear my voice clearly. Shockingly, the service center staff said the call feature works like that by default.Overall, it's a waste of money. I strongly advise **not to buy this product **",21 June 2025,1
"Audio quality is good and better than boat .Boat earbuds only has  base and mid are not clear in it but in jbl, it is balanced after costomising it the sound became goated as per price segment. Design is great, wider functionality,good charging speed,good battry life, and comfi in wearnig for long hour . Recommended product.",20 May 2025,1
"Good bass, volume less when compared to my older akg sound",12 August 2025,1
"I'll list down the pros and cons, but before that here's a story that will explain why I had yo buy these earbuds.In December of 2020 I first bought JBL C115. DEFINITELY THE BEST CHOICE OF HEADPHONES UNDER BUDGET. it lasted 4 years and a little more until 2025, 25th of April I had it in my trouser pockets and unknowingly spun it in the washing machine which damaged the hardware because it lacks water resistance.Therefore, I had to buy JBL WAVE BUDS 2. Tbh the build isn't as good as C115, JBL C115 had a perfect snug fit, it would completely get into my ear and the silicone tip was actually of good quality, maybe the sound and bass isn't as good as WAVE BUDS 2.overall WAVE BUDS 2 takes the trophy when it comes to the sound quality but its performance is EMBARRASSING in ANC, this is pure nonsense, JBL C115 didn't have any ANC yet the snug fit filtered all sounds. But this ANC nonsense in WAVE BUDS 2 is JUST PATHETIC!In Conclusion:Good sound quality, zero compromise in bass.Bad fitting and build.I hope that justifies the 3 stars.",19 May 2025,1
"After 3 week proper use. ..Design good,sound quality good for media  audio purposes nice bass crisp sound quality.But one drawback is the connection quality when u shift from song to calling ,there is always a glitch on sound quality while on call.So if u buying this to listen songs or media purpose its best value for money.",2 July 2025,2
"Awesome sound quality !!Only problem is removing headsets from the case and the case is also open, which makes security of headsets an issue",16 July 2025,2
"I've been using Oneplus Z2 ANC and JBL Tune 310 UsbC earphones for past year. I'd say Wave Buds 2 is better than Z2, but worse than Tune 310. Still has clarity expected from JBL, but sounds lack ""flavour"", vocals included. Good enough for audiobooks, podcasts or youtube, but  songs seem lacking.Buds are comfortable, though. Doesn't sit too deep in ear, and still stays on during walking. Practically forgot these were there. Having no stem helps, doesn't get accidentally knocked out.ANC makes almost no difference from passive noise isolation by in-ear buds. Talkthru mode is brilliant in amplifying voices over just ambient transparent mode.Mic isn't great, but that's just neckband earphones vs TWS problem. Battery life including case is definitely more than 24 hrs, just the buds is definitely more than 6 hrs.JBL app makes a lot of difference in customising the earphones. Can keep multiple user custom equaliser settings, audio balance etc.No lid on case, but magnets are strong. Not strong enough to hold on if case falls, though. Dropped case from abt 5ft on bed, 1 bud popped out. Might be better to buy a silicon cover with lid for this.",29 April 2025,2
"Audio is vera low ,can be used only if you are in idle state ,please don't go for it",11 July 2025,2
The media could not be loaded.,16 June 2025,2
"Don't fall for brand name because the jbl bass is not there very basic sound quality i mean i understand that this has 8 mm driver but still you might think that there will be any plus point after all this is a jbl brand but no if you are buying these earbuds for jbl name then don't buy very very basic sound quality they are giving at this price range, go for other brands at this price range.",26 July 2025,2
"The media could not be loaded.Anc is not up to the mark but its very good compared to other brands, sound quality is very nice , design is very unique topless , battery life is equally as mentioned and its light weighted earbudsI doesn't satisfy with Functionality bcs i chose which earbuds does volume control, playback control or mode change control but in the volume control or playback control or mode control i can't modify the change like 1 tap i stop the song and 2 tap i need to change next song or tap and hold for volume up-downHere basically its fix like 1 tap u play-pause2 tap you change next song 3 tap change previous song  i can not change this tap settings like 1 tap i want to change the next song 2 tap i want to change previous song or 3 tap i want to play - pause",16 January 2025,2
Good one. It would be great if it had a cap.,26 May 2025,2
Sound is very soft but clearBass is not goodBattery backup is averageFeatures are awesomeQuality is good,14 May 2025,2
ANC is not that greatNot very Protective Case Design (No cap or top layer)Touch is hard with the shape of the budsHard to set the gesture (Only the Give setting user cannot change it as he or she likes)Comfortable but not much.,15 July 2025,2
Good sound,4 May 2025,3
"This is surely a poorly designed JBL product. There is no lid for the earpod. The magnet appears strong, but the earpod keeps detaching from the case. Also, the earpod performance is just okay.I ordered two pieces and got them delivered two days back. As I found there is no lid for the case I called up the helpline on the same day of delivery. The first person assured me return pick up in four days. As there was no update on the app about the return pick up, I called up again. This time the Amazon response was nothing can be done as the picture showed no lid for the earpod case.My advise, consider something else. I am also thinking of moving out of Amazon.",18 July 2025,3
Look way uglier in real life photos are definitely enhanced. Also way too big and not fit for girls. Bought them for my sister but won’t fit in her ears so i am stuck with pink headphones now😃,30 June 2025,3
"Poor sound quality, poor fitting into the ears (at least for me), low battery backup, and the worst for taking calls. Not at all recommended at any price point.",11 July 2025,3
"Totally love the feel of the product, the performance, happy on those fronts with my purchase. BUT, really very concerned about there being no cover to shut the case!When the ear pieces are inside, I'm afraid they may fall out of my pocket after dislodging from their place (despite the magnet, the fear is there). When the ear pieces are in use, then I'm constantly worrying about how much dust may gather inside the case!What did JBL achieve by eliminating the cover?!? It makes zero sense, if they are trying to improve ergonomics, zero sense for the customer's peace of mind!I was in 2 minds for asking for a full refund because there's no clear mention of this, I simply thought the graphics are modified to show only what's important. Silly of me, thus I didn't ask for the refund, but for future reference I hope everyone reads this.A GREAT listening device, in a really silly design!",23 May 2024,3
The best thing is that the build quality. As u know jbl has its own quality. People looking for anc please dont go for it. But this is an exclent product for those who prefer listening music without compromising budget. Gaming might delay for 1 sec but thats fine as a bgmi player. I took this only because i needed a buds design. People with a wide ear might prefer the stick version which is jbl beam. The best thing is the auto connect option with android and ios. Bettery life is almost 8hrs in one strech and other 24 hrs with case. I could go easily 6 to 7 hrs while playing games. Video mode and putting the equalizer in vocal makes everghhing perfect. Its an value for money product. People looking for ease of use could get this. Appearance looks classy in black.battery life is great in this product. Get this Ease.,9 June 2024,3
Been using this headphones for 18 months.Sound quality is good. There is no ANC. It does support ambient aware.Build quality is good and battery is decent.Touch controls are too less. Design looks cool.But don't buy it if your are planning to spend another 3000 after 18 months.One of the earpieces go faulty and don't charge up,18 May 2025,3
Drops of ear. Poor holding,2 April 2025,3
I didn't realise that this earpod case has no cover. Other than that the product is working fine,11 April 2025,3
Nice,30 July 2025,3
Worst sound quality,26 July 2025,4
"Call and mic quality sucks.Volume is often times too low.Needs to be reset to factory settings often,cause this device has gained sentience of its own and disconnects after a min or two.Bass is non existent in this device.Uncomfortable to wear most of the time.No return or exchange option.DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT.Battery Life is average and charging speed is okay.I now seriously doubt the quality of JBL products. Very disappointed to get cheated on by a trusted brand.",26 July 2025,4

Poor sound quality.. JBL disappointed me..,18 July 2025,4
"Very very poor sound qualityNo button to increase soundSo much poor sound, no bass, not upto the mark of brand JBL. Very disappointed. Sound clarity is not also good.Better not to buy this particular product of JBL.Fits in ear perfectly.At last I returned it. Very much dissatisfied.",8 August 2025,4
"Not a good one, no cover, quality average, not cost effective",30 June 2025,4
Very good,8 April 2025,4
This lvl of price and the quality of sound and product disappointed me and make ke hate i recently brought tour one m2 that works fine but as price range the anc doesn't work that expected also sound feels low this wave bud is also uncomfortable if wearing for more than hour design and features is only worth but this price range wasn't expecting that 🙂👍🏼,22 July 2025,4
"Look if any one have budget around 3000, you don't buy any thing go for this product no one compete these product around these price range.Every things is good like buds and there box charging is also well not too good but ok with fast charging support...While for voice every one know that JBL is excellent in this category bass is medium.One thing which is bad noise cancellation is not good.I am expecting good but literally there is no noise cancellation . Overall product is good if we ignore noise cancellation.",7 September 2024,4

"I am writing a review after using this for a month,  I would not suggest this earbuds for bike riders while will go for long rides why because it is too noisy like wind sound is irritating in the ear not only riding a bike but also when wind is blowing the sound is irritating, if you are a music lover please don't buy it and I will give 1 rating for this ear buds and as mentioned in the description there is no active noise cancellation, please stay away from this cheap products and last but not least there is no return for this product so be cautious before buying this product",11 June 2025,5

"Why did you pick this product vs others?:Didnt liked the product at all sound quality is good but the case doesnt have a protective cap.While taking out the buds from the case it always falls from your hand as design of the case is very small, for the price they charging the case ruins it all and the call quality on this is also pretty much bad .lost one of my earpod from the case when it fell down as it doesn’t bave a cap .Left with only one now .",26 June 2025,5

Bad quality product specially in terms of handling,6 June 2025,5

Definitely a big upgrade on OnePlus buds. Very lightweight and stay put in the ear. Overall a good purchase for someone looking for a cheaper alternative to AirPods without compromising much on the sound quality.,28 May 2025,7

I want to return but there is only replacement option guys pls do not order even ever by mistake 😭🙏😭🙏😭🙏.....,7 August 2025,7
The design is such that does not have a covering lid. Hence the ear pods easily drop out easily. If you drop it on a wet surface water will easily get inside.Very weird case which does not have a protecting case.,19 March 2025,7
It’s expected that the current generation Bluetooth devices are able to connect to multiple devices at a time. Unfortunately this one doesn’t have it. And the lack of casing on top is a bad choice of design. Not recommended.,6 October 2024,7

JBl products i have used  before also they were superb but in this segment they are not upto the mark",15 March 2023,8
The worstest earphones on the planet! There is an option called noice cancellation where it cancels the person’s noice but makes all the other surrounding sounds veryy very loud and clear… is this even called a noice cancellation feature??? Bloody hell with the earpods. Not even a penny worth!!! Bloody earpods! Shame on JBL company! Literally cheapest quality with higher price!!!,28 May 2025,8
