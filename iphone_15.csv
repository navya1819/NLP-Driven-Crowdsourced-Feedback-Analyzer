"I’ve been using this phone for a while now, and I’m really happy with it. It looks great—sleek and easy to hold—and the screen is super vibrant. Performance is smooth, whether I’m browsing or playing games, with no lag. The camera takes great photos in most conditions, and the battery easily lasts me through the day. It charges quickly too, which is a bonus. Overall, this phone gives great value for the price and has everything I need without the high-end price tag. Totally recommend it!",4 August 2025,1
"""Sleek, superfast & stunning! 📱✨Got my iPhone 15 from Amazon – quick delivery, perfect packaging. Gorgeous display, amazing camera, lightning performance & all-day battery. Totally worth it!""",11 August 2025,1
"Always an iOS user, very much user friendly. My 5th iPhone. The best part is it is C type. Didnot go for iPhone 16 because of the lens placement.  Got this for 57k after cash back. Charging speed is good size is perfect. Display is nice. Camera quality if extraordinary. Perfect in weight.",8 August 2025,1
"The iPhone 15 is a noticeable step up from previous models. The design feels premium, and the new green color is subtle yet refreshing. Performance is smooth — apps launch instantly, and multitasking is seamless. The camera system is excellent, especially in low light, and photos come out crisp and vibrant. Battery life easily lasts a full day, even with heavy use. The display is bright and clear, perfect for watching videos or browsing. If you're upgrading from an older iPhone, the iPhone 15 feels like a worthy investment. It’s reliable, fast, and beautifully designed.",26 May 2025,1
"The camera quality is excellent — especially for photos in low light — and the battery life easily lasts me a full day. Performance is smooth and fast, nice sound quality,  bought for a better price",2 August 2025,1
THE MOBILE QUALITY AND THE CAMERA QUALITY IS EXCELLENT ALSO THE SPEED ITS GIVING IS GOOD. VALUE FOR MONEY.,2 August 2025,1
"DesignOne of the most noticeable changes to the iPhone 15 is its new design. The phone now has rounded edges, which makes it feel more comfortable in the hand. It also has a new camera bump that is less pronounced than the one on the iPhone 14.DisplayThe iPhone 15 has the same 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR display as the iPhone 14. However, the new display is brighter and has better contrast. It also supports HDR10 and Dolby Vision.PerformanceThe iPhone 15 is powered by the new A16 Bionic chip, which is the fastest mobile chip on the market. The A16 Bionic chip is up to 20% faster than the A15 Bionic chip in the iPhone 14.CameraThe iPhone 15 has a new 48-megapixel main camera. The new camera sensor is larger than the one in the iPhone 14, and it has better low-light performance. The iPhone 15 also has a new 12-megapixel ultrawide camera and a new 12-megapixel telephoto camera.Battery lifeThe iPhone 15 has the same battery life as the iPhone 14. This means that you can expect to get around a day of use on a single charge.  Overall  The iPhone 15 is a solid upgrade over the iPhone 14.ProsNew design with rounded edgesMore powerful A16 Bionic chip found in 14 proNew 48-megapixel main cameraBrighter display with upto 2000 nits brightnessUSB C can be used for anythingDynamic IslandConsNo 120hz displayNo Macro photography",6 October 2023,1
Goood phone for the price if u into apple . Great cameras it’s nice to have a proper 2x zoom on normal variant and not loosing much quality and it also nice to have usb c and it charge okey speed . But whenever I play games it heats up (not soo hot but hot enough to know) fast that’s the only issue I faced using this phone,24 May 2025,1
"Just made the transition and here’s my POV on the first ~2 month of usePros- Battery Life is awesome, easily get about a day plus on this, so no Compliants- Screen fluidity is smooooooth! Understandable as I’m transitioning into an OLED from LCD in XR. The panel gets a solid peak brightness quotient so happy here- Screen brightness is good as compared to XR, 2200 nits, but I hardly go beyond 30% brightness to save some juice. Whilst outside I did crank it up and it’s spotless- Dynamic Island is fun, yet to use it to the fullest. Like the way it shows the ETA on delivery and Uber. Simple solution instead of you having to get into the app to check on the ETA- Weight, this phone is soo bloody light!! Understandable as XR was a brick, this is soo welcome- Camera is awesome, love the 48MP intervention, the portrait mode and cinematic mode does the job for me.- The Apple eco system, I enjoy seamless integration of my Watch, Mac, IPad Air and IPhone- Apples approach on Security!- Transferring data from my XR to 15 using the built in app is flawlessCons- The phone was over heating , there is a solution to this from Apple = back up the phone and then erase and reset the phone… including your eSIM settings.. once done set up the phone with the back up….. works like a charm- I still believe Apple should have thrown in a charging brick with such purchasesIndustry memes- USB C : honestly don’t give a jack for the reviews out there on this. It’s just a mode of charging for me and that’s it. I’m not going to be transferring any data so yea, 2.0 speed yadadada - thank you so much- Blue is not blue but white! Think people whining about this should go back to 13/14 or those ludicrous blues in Androids!! These are pestle shades people!!- Buying an Apple product to show off!! I mean, you even serious? You buy a product and then comment on why you should not buy one?- 60hz refresh rate for a 80k phone : save your jokes people, there are many of us who appreciate quality and security than how the screen refreshes. For non gamers like me, panel that is here is apt. I’ve seen a ton of folks buying 120hz phones and using it only to make calls, watch some videos and for textingTips of managing battery health- Switch off background app refresh for apps you don’t need back ground refresh- Avoid wireless charging as this heats your devise up- I charge my phone only using a power bank  not direct wired or wireless charging- Don’t let the battery go below 20%, keep it always between 95% and 20%- Switch off location services and allow only certain app that needs your location service- Switch on Charging Optimisation under the battery section- I don’t use vibrate mode for rings/incoming calls etc- My XR after 5 years of use has 86% battery health so I guess I know what I’m recommending aboveVendor Experience : Appario Retail Private Limited. 5/5, been a regular customer and they have never disappointed me even once. The purchase experience is breezy and quick, thanks team for the support and look forward to the collaboration in the future.….. watch out for this space. Will keep updating in case of significant change in experience",7 October 2023,1

Just amazing…….,8 August 2025,4
premise:Give it some time to adjust. Feel how iPhone learns from your usage behavior a d adjust accordingly. Just right for me who uses both android and ios side by side.Camera & Photos App:Good-Great shots & Great photos app tailored with memories feature with I like a lot which gives more than the Google photos.Charging:I do charge like mostly once in 2 days according to usage.Charges 80% in like 30-40mins later it because of Battery Optimization os on it charges slowly to reach the peak to let out the heat go away.Performance:Smooth and best compatible with Apple apps and good compatibility with non apple apps too.I use Next cloud own server to sync all docs. As I don't want to subscribe to icloud. Surprisingly works without any huddles.even though we have more high specs phones in the market with ram and storage. The truth is that iOS has eccentric beauty in it.,11 July 2025,4

"Phone performance is obviously good. Processing is smooth. The only issue I saw in it after using of 3-4 months that with its body color. Around corner and camera edges it slightly coming out. Don't expect this from high end phones. First I thought it is because of cover but there is no cover around camera area. Also, battery performance needs to improve compare to Samsung (with this range of price).",4 July 2025,7

"I recently purchased the iPhone 15 in Pink from Amazon, and I couldn’t be happier with my decision! From the moment I unboxed it, the sleek design and soft pastel pink color caught my attention—it looks even better in person than in pictures. Phone is lightweight aluminum and glass build, making the phone feel premium yet comfortable to hold. The pink shade is elegant and subtle, perfect for anyone who loves a touch of sophistication. The 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR display is bright, sharp, and offers vibrant colors. Whether watching videos or scrolling through social media, the experience is smooth and immersive. The 48MP main camera and 12MP ultra-wide lens take incredible photos, even in low light. The details, sharpness, and colors are truly impressive. Portrait mode works beautifully, capturing professional-looking shots effortlessly. The front camera is equally good for selfies and FaceTime. Charging with the USB-C port is much more convenient than before, and fast charging is a plus. The delivery was fast and secure, with the iPhone arriving in perfect condition. The packaging was intact, and setting up the phone was a breeze. If you're looking for a stylish, powerful, and reliable phone, the iPhone 15 in Pink is a fantastic choice.",21 March 2025,9
