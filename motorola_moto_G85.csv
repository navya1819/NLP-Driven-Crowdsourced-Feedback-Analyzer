"I’ve been using the Motorola G85 5G (8GB RAM, 128GB) for a few days now, and I’m very happy with the performance.✅ Display: The curved pOLED display is bright, smooth, and looks very premium. It feels like a flagship phone.✅ Performance: Everything runs smoothly – from social media apps to multitasking.✅ Battery: Easily lasts a full day with regular use. Fast charging is a bonus.✅ Design: Slim, lightweight, and very stylish.✅ Camera: Good quality photos in daylight. Front camera is decent for selfies.I love the clean Android experience without unnecessary apps. For a price under ₹17,000, this is a great value-for-money smartphone. I would definitely recommend it to others.",11 June 2025,1

"Nice ,over all good",30 July 2025,1
"It is a great value for money phone but i would still not suggest to buy it because it has a faulty charging port and this is its manufacturing defect, it was working great in the beginning and after one month it has started to have charging problem like not charging sometimes and sometimes turbo charging was not working and many more, and as soon as i brought it to the service center as soon as i told them its a Motorola phone with charging issue they directly asked me whether is it G85 edge and i told yes so they show me 3-4 brand new phones all with same issue all were under warranty and were bought within 1-2 months. They were getting replacement of charging board free of cost but still nobody wants to have their brand new purchased phone to take to service center and open up. And everybody know that once the phone gets opened its never going t be same because service centers  don't use adhesive to glue them as good as it comes from factory there will always be a gap and always a chance to open up someday by its own.",17 April 2025,1
"SUPERB PHONE. SLIM, LIGHT WEIGHT, VERY HANDY, GRIP IS EXCELLENT, RESOLUTION IS EXCELLENT",15 July 2025,1
"Did come with minor issues. Vibration not working. Issue with ringer (sometimes works and sometimes doesn't), says turbo charger but doesn't charge as expected, lock screen to home screen lags a bit which is irritating. Issue with Youtube videos where the screen is overlapped/ glitched, needs to be restarted until it is resolved. Not very impressive with the product. Would choose an IQOO phone over this.P.S: Not sure if this is all because of the Android 15 update.",11 August 2025,1
"Awesome mobile, a premium look, clean Stock android UI, moto branding, Pantone color, Curve display, camera, Moto gestures... everything is good, except.. you can add only one face... fingureprint scanner is not as fast as the neo devices, but, considering the price range.... this is a Loot.... Go for it blindly.. I promise, you won't get the premium feel in this budget segment other that this...",5 August 2025,1

"Phone is totally good no doubt in that. But the seller gave us PRE-ACTIVATED device which was used in October 2024, as we were setting up the phone it the slot 2 in the phone was not detecting the SIM card. I Switched the sim 1 to check is there a problem in SIM card but no it was the issue in the SLOT 2 only..!",20 June 2025,4

"I recently got my hands on the Motorola G85, and I must say, it’s exceeded my expectations at every turn! The Camera quality is impressive, packed with AI features that take my photos to a whole new level—it feels like having a professional setup right in my pocket. The smooth performance of this device is worth applauding; everything flows effortlessly, whether I'm multitasking or enjoying my favorite apps.This phone is incredibly light and sleek, making it perfect to carry around all day without any bulk. The sound quality is rich and immersive, ideal for music lovers and movie enthusiasts alike. The battery life keeps up with me all day, giving me power when I need it most without constant recharges. And that screen clarity—crystal clear with vibrant colors, it’s a visual treat!Motorola G85 proves that a premium experience doesn't have to come with a premium price tag. Highly recommend it to anyone looking for a reliable, feature-packed smartphone!",28 October 2024,4
